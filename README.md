# -SQL---Pep-Chat-Marketing-Performance-MRR-Calculation

### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the marketing campaign performance and Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for a subscription-based service that offers coaching sessions via text. Users can subscribe through either monthly or yearly plans, and the goal is to assess the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns.

#### The analysis aims to evaluate key metrics such as:
- Impressions, clicks, signups, and purchased subscriptions.
- Cost per conversion (signups and subscriptions).
- Total revenue generated by users acquired through each marketing campaign, projected until the end of 2024.
- Using SQL, the project involves extracting and joining data from various tables and calculating key metrics, including Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and cost per conversion.

### Objectives
The core objective of this project was to provide an in-depth analysis of marketing performance through the following:
- Data Extraction: Combining relevant data from USERS, CAMPAIGNS, and SUBSCRIPTIONS tables to obtain user behavior, marketing costs, and subscription metrics.
- MRR Calculation: Calculating the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) using both yearly and monthly subscription data.
- Linking Data: Creating a comprehensive dataset that links marketing cost, conversions (signups and subscriptions), and revenue to evaluate campaign efficiency.

### Data Sources
- USERS: Contains user_id, signup_date, and the marketing campaign from which the user was acquired.
- CAMPAIGNS: Holds daily marketing data, including campaign cost, number of impressions, and clicks.
- SUBSCRIPTIONS: Contains information about user subscriptions, such as the subscription type, start and end dates, and plan price.

### Methodology
- Step 1: Extracting Data Using CTEs
The first step was to extract the relevant data from the USERS, CAMPAIGNS, and SUBSCRIPTIONS tables. Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), the data was combined to capture all relevant information about user signups, subscription plans, and marketing spend.
- Step 2: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Calculation
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is a key metric in subscription-based businesses. To calculate MRR, we created a table of all the months in 2024 and determined which subscriptions were active during each month. This provided the monthly revenue contribution for each subscription.
Next, the revenue for each subscription was calculated, differentiating between monthly and yearly plans, with yearly subscriptions prorated across 12 months.
- Step 3: Cohort Analysis for Revenue
A cohort analysis grouped users by their signup date and campaign, which allowed us to evaluate how much revenue was generated by each marketing campaign. The subscriptions_cohorted CTE grouped all subscription payments by the signup cohort.
- Step 4: Aggregating User Signups
User acquisition data was aggregated per day for each marketing campaign using the USERS table to count the number of signups.
- Step 5: Final Dataset for Campaign Performance
Finally, all the extracted data (marketing costs, user signups, subscription revenue, etc.) was combined into a single dataset to provide a comprehensive view of each campaign's performance, enabling the calculation of cost per conversion and overall return on investment. This is a snapshot of the data below:

### Key Insights
- MRR Trends: By evaluating the Monthly Recurring Revenue generated per campaign, we identified which campaigns contributed the most to revenue over time.
- Cost per Conversion: Calculating the cost per signup and cost per subscription allowed for a thorough analysis of campaign efficiency, aiding in future marketing budget decisions.
- Cohort Analysis: Grouping data into cohorts (based on signup date and campaign) helped evaluate the long-term revenue contributions of users acquired through different marketing campaigns.

### Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrated the use of SQL for extracting, transforming, and analyzing marketing and subscription data. Through this analysis, key metrics such as cost per conversion and MRR were calculated, providing valuable insights into the performance of marketing campaigns.
